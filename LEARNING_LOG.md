# ðŸ“– Learning Log â€“ Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, OpenTelemetry

This log tracks my hands-on learning journey in observability and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).  
Each entry represents progress, experiments, and takeaways.

---

## âœ… Week 1 (Sept 2025)
- Watched "Foundations of Observability" (Aref Karimi â€“ Udemy).
- Learned: Monitoring vs Observability, telemetry types (metrics, logs, traces).
- Hands-on: Set up Prometheus locally with Docker.
- GitHub update: Created this repo and added initial README.

---

## âœ… Week 2 (Planned)
- Install and configure Grafana locally.
- Connect Grafana to Prometheus â†’ build first dashboard.
- Experiment with alerts.
- Start Loki setup for log ingestion.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Goals for the Coming Weeks
- Integrate Grafana Loki + Promtail â†’ log ingestion pipeline.
- Deploy Grafana Tempo for distributed tracing.
- Learn OpenTelemetry basics and export traces/metrics to Grafana stack.
- Create and publish sample dashboards in this repo.
- Write blog-style notes in `/notes/` folder for each lab.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Long-Term Goal
Transition into **Observability Engineer / SRE role** by building:
- Strong practical skills in observability tools.
- GitHub portfolio showing dashboards, configs, and real-world labs.
- Confidence with metrics, logs, traces, alerting, and automation.
